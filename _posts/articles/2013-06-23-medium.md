There is plenty of media in the world already. And no matter what happens to traditional media economics, there’s nothing to stop the torrent of information rushing from smartphones, corporations, and new-fangled media startups onto the Internet, available for the world to see.

While it continues to be more and more efficient to put media-type stuff out there, we think there are big improvements to be made in a particular type of media “stuff”: That which is not necessarily personal and not necessarily news. That which we might just call ideas.

> prototypes allowed us to see things in one of two ways: Things that don’t work, and things that need work

What kind of ideas? Many kinds: A particular viewpoint on the happenings of the day (or of the past), hard-earned knowledge about how to do something better, a story that makes people laugh, smile, or feel something meaningful. If you have thoughts to share that you want to impact or influence people with—beyond just your friends and beyond 140 characters—we want to provide the tools and the place.

#### 6 Month Commitment
Product design isn’t just about getting to market—it would need refinement after launch.

Geoff would head up a team of 4 that would lead and help execute the UX of Medium with their existing team.

## Learning to design is learning to see, an adventure that gets more and more captivating the further you go. A love letter to my profession…

There’s always something special about the top crop of Dutch design graduates, but every once in a while one comes along that makes everyone sit up and take notice. In 2003, that was Joris Laarman. His Reinventing Functionality project at the Design Academy of Eindhoven [^1] fused function with ornament and was snatched up by Museum Boijmans [^2] Van Beuningen in Rotterdam.

_Design must **accept** some of the responsibility for creating many of the world’s current problems._

Since then, he has earned a reputation for himself as a designer with visionary ideas and a concern for societal issues. His first project out of school, the Bone Furniture range, was exhibited in the Friedman Benda gallery in New York, a limited edition series made from marble, porcelain and resin. While he calls it an “annoying coincidence” that much of his work has spawned major contemporary trends, it also testifies to its relevance to the issues that matter.
